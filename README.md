# Project


## Description

The **Game** is an interactive game where players control an animal (either a dog or a rabbit) and must collect different types of food while avoiding other objects. The goal is to score points by collecting the correct food items if the player touches the wrong objects the animal loses a life.


## Game Objectives

- **Food Collection:** 
  - The dog scores points by touching **meat** or **candy**.
  - The rabbit scores points by touching **carrot** or **candy**.

- **Life Loss:**
  - The dog loses a life when touching **carrot** or **bug**.
  - The rabbit loses a life when touching **meat** or **bug**.

- The game ends when the player runs out of lives, displaying a "Game Over" screen.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styles and visual design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and event management.


## Instructions to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click the start button to begin the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to move the animal.
5. Press space to change animal.
4. Try to collect the correct food and avoid the objects that cost lives.


## Difficulty
As the player progresses, the game's difficulty increases. For every 50 points scored, the speed at which food falls increases, making it harder for the player to keep up and requiring quicker coordination to avoid incorrect items.

- `styles.css`: Defines the styles and design of the game.
- `game.js`: Contains the main game logic, collision detection, and scoring.
